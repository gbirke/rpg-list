<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Tomorrow on Revelation III is a roleplaying game about surviving and overcoming
capitalism in a future among the stars. Four hundred years from now, aerospace
corporations have traversed the galaxy, colonizing this solar system and ones
beyond, and constructed space stations to create robust sites of manufacturing,
mining, and other industrial activities. You live on the heavily stratified
agricultural station Revelation III, where the deck youâ€™re born on determines
your profession, privileges, and possibilities. But beyond the monotonous work
of daily life, you make time for other work: work towards a better existence.

You are on the precipice of making major changes to the station, but reform is a
complex process. You work as a group to improve and transform your conditions
by creating meaning beyond productivity, balancing community betterment and
social imagination with individual survival and persistence.

In Tomorrow on Revelation III, you play to create the future your characters
dream of. You play until Revelation III is a station you would want to live on.
