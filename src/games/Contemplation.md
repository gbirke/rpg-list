There are three ways to use this book; what it will be for you will depend upon your own circumstances and wishes. It can be used as a quick RPG game, as a writing tool, or for solo journaling. Or even all three together.

**Game** - invent a character and take them through the pages, discovering who they are and what makes them tick. Absolutely not serious and just a lot of fun!

**Writing Tool** - take an invented character that you want to discover more about. By working through the questions, details will emerge to power you through any writing block you might be suffering.

**Solo Journaling** - go through the pages, exploring your own personality and feelings on a journey of self-exnloration and development.
