<!-- Excerpt Start -->
You are not a human, but you like human things like small talk and parties. You and some of your other non-human friends decide to dress up as humans and attend a human party. However, your non-human quirks show up at the most inconvenient times. Try to make your way through the party without it getting too out of hand.
