<!-- Excerpt Start -->
'The Terminator RPG' is the official roleplaying game based on 'The Terminator' movie and associated graphic novels published by Dark Horse comics.

Join the Human Resistance. The world is a wasteland—broken by the machines we built. Our own creations, our own hubris. Not in some distant future. Today. Now. The machines think they have won.  But there is one last chance for humankind, a secret weapon that Skynet in its infinite calculations could never have anticipated—you.

Play in any time zone—including the 1980s and future war. All the main characters from the movie, such as Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, and the T-800 are included, as is content from the graphic novels and all all-new, never seen before Terminator variants and hardware. 

The rulebook includes two mission packs, enabling you to relive 'The Terminator' movie and to join the fight to bring down Skynet in a not-so-distant future war.
