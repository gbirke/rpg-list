<!-- Excerpt Start -->

Ostro is a high seas fantasy RPG designed for solo play.

You are an adventurer and the captain of a nimble
sailing ship traveling the southern seas known as
Ostro. Before taking command of your own vessel you
served with a captain who was obsessed with finding
a long lost treasure. While onboard you heard
countless tales about this treasure, each more
extravagant than the last. Word is now getting out
that your former captain has found real evidence of
the treasure and a clue to its location. It is now a race
between you and an ocean full of adventurers to find
the fabled treasure.
