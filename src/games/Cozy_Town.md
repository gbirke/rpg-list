<!-- Excerpt Start -->
This game is an opportunity to sit down with friends and create a lovely town
together. You’ll play out an entire year of this town, across sweet spring, sunny
summer, soft autumn, and snuggled down winter. Together you’ll explore what makes
people, and the communities they’re in, feel safe and cozy.
