<!-- Excerpt Start -->
A thousand years ago, we built twelve giant mecha to fight a cataclysmic war. We
called them Thrones. Each was unique, a paragon of war designed for a specific
battlefield role. But for all their power, they were not invincible. Turtle Sam was
destroyed defending the Dyson Walls surrounding Epsilon Eridani. Heavenly
Thunder disappeared when the Starbridge fell. The remaining ten survived, their
pilots hailed as the saviours of humanity.

Down the generations since that great war, dynasties have formed, each drawing
its legitimacy from the ownership of a surviving Throne. These titans are ancient
weapons with grand legacies of battle and betrayal, but they are also symbols of
dominance and entitlement. Possession of a Throne bestows wealth, power,
authority over whole star systems, and a seat on the Galactic Council.
That’s why you’re going to steal one.

Stealing the Throne is a GMless storytelling game for 3–5 players. Together
you’ll build a Throne, and then devise its defences before taking them apart
one by one in an action-filled heist.
