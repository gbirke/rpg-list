<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Dialect is a story game about an isolated community, their language, and what it means for that language to be lost. It’s for three to five people and runs in three to four hours.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

### STORY GAMES
Story games are a structured way for people to tell stories together. The rules of the game help players invent fiction and share experiences that would be hard to craft from a blank page. In Dialect all players have equal authority at the table and a shared stake in the narrative. By giving more of yourself, you’ll get more from the game.

### THE ISOLATION

In Dialect, you’ll define and explore an isolated community through its beginning, rise, and end. You may be pilgrims to Mars, a cyberpunk gang fighting a megacorp, or students at an English boarding school. Some Isolations will be voluntary, others not. Some will choose to barricade themselves against an unforgiving world while others lie stranded and adrift from home. On their own, one thing is certain—these people will be left to simmer in what makes them special. They will change because of it. You will decide what they become.

### LANGUAGE BUILDING
You’ll tell the story of the Isolation by building their language. Over the course of the game, you will create new words off the fundamental traits of the community, the pivotal events that have defined their lives, and how they respond to a changing world. You will use the language you create to explore your character and advance the story of the Isolation. Each time a new word is made, the language grows, and the community is tightened.

Dialect’s core spark comes from gradually building up elements of language among players, who gain fluency in their own dialect over the course of play. From age to age, the Isolation will change and you’ll see those changes reflected in their language. In the end, you’ll define what happens to that language and community. Players take away both the story they’ve told and the dialect they’ve built together.
