<!-- Excerpt Start -->


Blood Feud is a role-playing game about toxic masculinity—
a term referring to certain common attitudes and behaviors
among men that cause harm to the men and to others around
them. It’s also a game about Vikings of pre-Christian Scandi­
navia. We chose to combine these two because modern media
depict­­­­ions of Vikings are rife with bloodshed, power struggles,
and wanton mayhem caused largely by toxic masculine attitudes.
Because of this, the Viking world is a perfect microcosm for looking
at and learning about toxic masculinity. It is simultaneously
far enough in the past that no one alive has experienced it,
yet familiar enough that we all have a clear image of it.

Over the course of a game you will be playing both the men
who behave in toxic ways and the people who are hurt by it.
However, the primary focus is to understand the power struggles
between the men. It’s hard to understand why someone would
be­have in a way that is cruel or outright reprehensible, without
having an embodied experience of what their perspective might
be like. That is what this game is about. By asking you to play
toxic men, we are hoping to show you not only the hows of toxic
masculinity, but also the whys—so that we can all learn how to
better combat the issue of men’s dominance.

Of course, it wouldn’t be enough to experience the perspective
of men without also talking about the consequences of their
behaviour. It is clear from the Icelandic Sagas, the closest historical
accounts we have of the period, that these social consequences
were very real and that generations of people could get locked
into bloody feuds due to the toxic behaviour of a few. In the
spirit of these sagas, we have created a game where it is natural to
include two, if not three, generations into the same story. In this
way, there is always a social context to the action—beyond the
men themselves—as their peers, partners, parents, and children
are all affected by their actions.
