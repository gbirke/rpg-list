<!-- Excerpt Start -->
At night, you sleep. And when you sleep, you dream. But these dreams are not idle
imaginings, without consequence. No, through some curse or blessing, your
dreams tap into something greater. What this means for you, what you will do to
escape or to harness this, is for you to decide and discover.

When you sleep, without fail, you find yourself in the Dream, a persistent
world where you meet others like yourself and many more entirely unlike yourself.
It is a world of wonders and dangers, both personal and alien. Each night, it is
your refuge and your prison. And each night, you fear you might not wake up
again.

The Dream is not like the waking world. It is not solid and Euclidean. It resists
attempts to scientifically determine its basic physics. It runs more on ideas and
motivations than mass and energy. Nevertheless, it has cause and effect and
consequence, though they can be twisted things.

For while you Dreamers have powers in the dream, abilities beyond what you
may know in the waking world, that does not mean that the Dream is safe for you.
For not all that enter the Dream manage to escape it. And those that do are always
changed.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

Dreampunk is played with a deck of cards, but not a deck of ordinary playing cards.
The cards should be surreal, artistic, and laden with metaphor. These can be the
Dreampunk deck of cards, but other cards such as Dixit or Mysterium cards or
perhaps tarot or oracle decks can also work well. Each Dreamer starts each session
of play with a hand of 5 cards which will be used as a resource. Dreamers will
refresh their hands back up to 5 cards when they wake from the Dream or find
respite.
