<!-- Excerpt Start -->

You are reality’s last defenders, elite investigators
combating the plots of the Esoterrorists, a loose affiliation
of occult terrorists intent on tearing the fabric of the world
and letting the monsters in.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

Unlike other investigative roleplaying games, The
Esoterrorists’ GUMSHOE rules system ensures that the plot
never grinds to a halt due to a failed die roll. As top paranormal
detectives, you never fail in your areas of expertise. When
necessary, you can expend extra effort to glean more from the
evidence than any plodding journeyman could hope to find.

### Who Are You?

You and your teammates are elite investigators drawn from
various walks of life, all with a background in investigation. You
may be a world-weary homicide detective, a lab-coated forensic
scientist, a grizzled old-school reporter, a tweed-jacketed
scholar, or even a hanger-on in the criminal underworld.
You lead a double life. Most of the time, you’re an ordinary
civilian, paying the rent and leading a normal existence. However,
you belong to a cell of a secret, worldwide organization called
the Ordo Veritatis (OV). This benevolent conspiracy, which
operates with the tacit approval of the world’s major powers,
fights the machinations of the Esoterrorists, who seek personal
power by evoking malign paranormal phenomena.

### How Does the World Work?

Magic doesn’t come into the world easily; it has a basic set
point of sanity that’s hard to tamper with. That’s why ghosts
and other occult manifestations are typically only encountered
in certain haunted locations by highly sensitive individuals. But
when people begin to doubt the sanity of their everyday world,
these breaks in the fabric of reality become easier to create.Your
enemies stage hauntings, create Fortean phenomena, and insert
false evidence of nonexistent conspiracies into the historical
record. These begin as hoaxes but, as they create mass hysteria,
become real. As they peak, they spawn the so-called Creatures
of Unremitting Horror, bizarre modernist monsters who must
be destroyed before they become as much a part of consensus
reality as lions or convenience stores.
