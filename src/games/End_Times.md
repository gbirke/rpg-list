End Times is a pencil-and-paper role playing game
where players play Survivors. Survivors are people
who will be some of the last humans left at the end
of the upcoming apocalypse(s). Somehow, Survivors
have gained the ability to send their consciousnesses
back or forth ten years in time. The future version of
each Survivor has given some warning about a coming
apocalypse to their present-day selves. It is those
young-adult pre-apocalypse selves that the players
play as. The goal of the game is to figure out what
will cause the apocalypses and, working with other
Survivors, prevent them from happening.
