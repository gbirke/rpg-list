<!-- Excerpt Start -->
A wizard murdered and enslaved your people. Now you're among strangers, on a bloody quest for revenge. Let all wizards beware!

To play The Barbarian's Bloody Quest, you need two volunteer GMs (or more than two, it's fine) to play against you. You have your booklet of rules, which you're responsible for knowing and bringing into play for yourself, and your volunteers have their own document: "The Book of Doomed Wizards," their guide to the wizards you'll face on your quest. Don't read it! It's for them, not for you.

Your goal in the game is to follow your quest for revenge into danger, and to emerge victorious when you can.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

Each session that you play is an adventure in your barbarian's quest: an encounter with a wizard, whose magics you'll face and whose magical defenses and guardians you'll hope to defeat. You can play as often or rarely as you like, and you can call upon the same volunteers, or different ones, every time you play. Just pass The Book of Doomed Wizards over to them so that they can mark your progress through it.
