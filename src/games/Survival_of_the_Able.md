<!-- Excerpt Start -->

In Survival of the Able, you’re a disabled
person living in a European almshouse when
the Black Death comes to your town. Little is
known about where the plague originated or
how to stop it, but those who die from it are
rising again—and they’re hungry for flesh.
Since everyone else has succumbed to the
plague, it’s up to a handful of you to make
your way out of town and away to safety.
You may not be the biggest, the strongest,
or the fittest, but you’ll come out a better
person if you’re able to survive.
