<!-- Excerpt Start -->

Our home is breaking, and we have no one to blame but ourselves.
We built a flawed society, and soon it will destroy itself.
Though most of us can’t perceive the coming doom,
a Hero arises to fight against the impending collapse.
Downfall is the story of how we try to save
our society and ourselves, and fail.


Downfall is a collaborative role-playing game for 3 people. The
game takes 2-4 hours to play. During play we’ll create a fictional
society together, then play out its destruction.
The object of the game is to find out how our society collapses and
to make its downfall tragic, beautiful, and meaningful. Together
we’ll create a rich world, play characters struggling amidst the
growing chaos, and witness the self-destruction of our home.
