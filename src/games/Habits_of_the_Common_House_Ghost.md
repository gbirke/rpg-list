A GM-less game for 1-4 players

<!-- Excerpt End -->

Once upon a time, you were alive, I mean the kind of alive you
used to think of as “alive.” You had a job, needed to eat, drink, and
entertain. You’re a different kind of alive now. You, and the others like
you. You have a body in a grave somewhere, but you still remember
what it was to have obligations. Some who are like you have
unfinished business or are tied to places or things. Some of them scare
and some of them just want to move on. But you, you just want to keep
living. You’re not alone in this want. You found someone to give you
a job. You sleep, well, you dream anyway. You get up in the morning
and have your coffee and your cigarette before taking the subway
to your job downtown where you spend the day with your friends
daydreaming of when you can go back home. There’s a nostalgia to
it. There’s a kind of life to it that you find comfort in. The un-mandated
daily toil.
