*He Who Laughs Last* is a Cthulhu Dark scenario set
in contemporary Los Angeles for three to six player characters (PCs). It was written as a one-shot that can be run in six to eight hours, although notes for including
it as part of an ongoing campaign are included in the sidebar titled “Running a Cthulhu Dark Campaign.”


The scenario centers around an up-and-coming comedian named Bryan Tobler, who has made a deal with the devil—a descendent of one of the PCs from the distant future who is known as Ralph Ares (pronounced “Rafe”). This deal has given Bryan access to a very powerful spell called the Laughing Hyena, which allows its caster to make people laugh. Bryan has used the spell over the past two years to become incredibly successful. Unfortunately, the Laughing Hyena requires its caster to regularly take energy from others to keep the spell powerful, so Bryan has begun killing people to maintain his success.
