<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Secrets of the Vibrant Isle is a solo, tabletop, roleplaying game
where you portray a character shipwrecked on a fantastical
island. As you play the game, you'll scavenge the shipwreck,
protect your camp, improve yourself, and explore many
dozens of the island's beautiful wonders and dark corners.
And you'll meet the island's inhabitants.
