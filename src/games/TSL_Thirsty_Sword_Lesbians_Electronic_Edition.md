<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Thirsty sword lesbians battle a tyrannical ruler when her enforcers march
down from the frosty north. They rocket through the stars to safeguard
diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and
share shy glances at the corner cafe, until they need to take up their swords
to defend their community. Even in conflict, they seek peace with their
opponents—and sometimes connect more deeply than anyone expects.
Your thirsty sword lesbians may be fantasy heroes, or may inhabit a galaxy
of laser swords and starships. Anywhere that swords cross and hearts race,
thirsty sword lesbians are there.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

### Love, Swords, and Adventure

A sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping
others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around wandering
matchmakers flying from planet to planet.

### A Positive Community

Whether it’s an entire planet, a knightly order, or just the coven to which
the protagonists belong, they are part of a community that embodies
important ideals worth fighting for, even as you strive to make it better.
Misogyny, transphobia, racism, and other forms of bigotry are not the
norm here, though they may be the norm elsewhere if the players wish to
confront these issues.

### Being a Thirsty Sword Lesbian

As a thirsty sword lesbian, you can:

- Change the world for the better by acting with integrity and compassion
- Fight when something is worth fighting for
- Redeem or seduce adversaries
- Make out, dance, and carouse
- Solve problems with courage, wit, and style
- Deliver zingers and bon mots
- Make lasting friends and enemies
