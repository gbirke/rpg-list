<!-- Excerpt Start -->

You’re dragged into a treacherous fantasy world made from your own fears, doubts and desires. There’s only one way to escape — but with limitless adventure within your grasp, would you even want to?

In *DIE: The Roleplaying Game*, you play a group of authentically flawed people from the real world who gather together to play a game but become trapped in a magical realm. What are they prepared to sacrifice to escape? What are they prepared to sacrifice to stay?

### What is DIE?
DIE is a comic book series by Kieron Gillen and Stephanie Hans, where a group of real-world, deeply-flawed adults are transported to a fantasy world via a predatory, sinister roleplaying game. There, they’re transformed into Paragons, each of whom is a warped take on the core fantasy roleplaying classes. In this world, they get to confront how their lives have diverted from their youthful fantasies, to confront their darker sides and buried secrets. They generally cause trouble.
It’s been jokingly described as “Goth Jumanji.” It is a portal fantasy for adults and is available from all good book shops.

### What does DIE RPG let you do?
In this game, you make your own entirely bespoke version of the DIE story.
