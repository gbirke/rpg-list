<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Oneironaut is a narrative solo game that you play while sleeping.

Yes, you read it right.

Every night, before going to sleep, you receive a mission from Ahiag̃.
You will need to ﬁnd an Oneiric Domain and dominate a Gnosis, as to
gradually remove Yurupari's evil domain.

You must try and fulfill this mission in your dreams. An Oneironaut needs
to be able to control and conduct their own dreams as to shape them
according to their desire.

Upon awakening, you register your dream and assess how much you
contributed to the war between Ahiag̃ and Yurupari.
