<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Captainâ€™s Log is a solo journaling RPG where you find yourself in the command of a ship, its crew embarking on a vast mission through space. The limits to this mission are defined by your imagination, and the stories you bring to life. Playing the Captain's Log is simple and offers hours of creative storytelling fun.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Captain's log has two modes:

### Campaign

A 50 entry mission journaling adventure where you will be given the scenario outline of each log entry. Each of these entries will journal a mission, a day and event of note onboard your very own ship.

From there it's up to you to decide where the story goes and what twists and turns await the ship and its crew.

## Scenario Generation

These are one off scenarios that can just be generated by simply using a 6 sided dice, or failing that the random number sheet located at the end of this RPG.

This system will see you generate a unique combination that becomes your scenario.

The system will give you:

* A location
* A Plot Event
* A Subplot

Then as with the campaign the rest is up to you.
These can be played in single stand alone missions, or perhaps you want to chain them together and make another campaign to take your crew on.
