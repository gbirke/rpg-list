<!-- Excerpt Start -->
A storytelling game of nightlife and nostalgia for 1 to 6 players, face to face, over video call, or by forum. It uses the "For the Queen" mechanic.

The top of the steep and narrow staircase, hot and sweaty and exhilarated.
Feeling thoroughly spent. A night at your favorite club is over. But
tonight, the club closes forever.

*What whill you take with you as you descend the stairs for the last
time?*
