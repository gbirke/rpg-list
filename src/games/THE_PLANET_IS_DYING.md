<!-- Excerpt Start -->
A one-page hack of *Fall of Magic* by Ross Cowman, inspired by Total Recall, the Fifth Element & Final Fantasy VII.



The planet is dying.  
Only the chosen can heal it, but they donâ€™t know how.  
The corporation were hunting the chosen & somehow your ragtag group have also become targets.  
Help the chosen navigate the perilled city, discover their true purpose & save the planet.
