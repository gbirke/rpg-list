<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Hell for Leather is a fast flowing action game of explosive death
and bloody murder. Using a tower of dice to resolve challenges, it’s
tense, speedy and shallow. Perfect for a night of cursing and rivalry.
In the standard setting*, you play a team of contestants running
across the globe, monitored by a gruesome game show called
“Hell for Leather.” In this book, you’ll find rules for creating the
contestants of that show and for working out how the story
evolves. If you’re playing the standard game, here’s a little back
story.

### The Show

Hell for Leather is the world’s deadliest game show, a celebration of
gore and pursuit. Each week the contestants are ruthlessly hunted
down and executed as they flee across the globe, slaughtered and
then butchered by an elite tactical unit they call the Hunters. It’s
bloody, horrific and totally unfair. In this game, you play the role of
these contestants and your job is to survive.
Anyone can cash you in as a prize, from the old lady behind the net
curtains, to the freelance syndicates. You’re a walking lottery ticket,
the answer to a man’s prayers. Eligible claimants can phone the
Network with a tip-off, or just deliver your head in a sack. Last week
some kid won twenty grand when his dog found a contestant’s
wrist bone in a bus wreck. It’s a tough old game.

### Contestants

What sort of screw up would volunteer for such barbarity? You’d be
surprised. There’s some mega cash bucks in the pipeline, and that’s just
the start of it. The guys in charge, the Network, they run everything, and
that means everything. You got a brother in prison? Not anymore. You want
someone erased? Consider it done. All the world’s a stage, and these guys?
They run the fucking show.
