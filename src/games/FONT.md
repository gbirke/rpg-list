<!-- Excerpt Start -->
FONT is a story game of hope and loss for 2 to 4 players.
Each session is a stand-alone story, unfolding over 1 to 3
hours. Players take on the role of travelers crossing a perilous landscape called the FISSURE. These travelers seek
a powerful place called the FONT, which can change their
dying world. The characters in each game of FONT may
be wildly different, but they are always driven by a shared
purpose: a hope that their world could be saved.
