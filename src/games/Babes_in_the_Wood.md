<!-- Excerpt Start -->

Babes in the Wood is a tabletop roleplaying game where players act as various kids & critters to wander an endless mysterious forest on Halloween night. 

Encounter the peculiar folks who reside within and help solve their problems while confronting your own relationships & fears. Catch literal lightning bugs for the North Witch's potions, bare witness to the royal cat wedding of Sir Poppy and the Princess, or simply tell tall tales with your friends as you traverse the strange eternal Wood. But be wary: dark forces and foes lie in the tangled depths of the forest and have their sights set on you...
