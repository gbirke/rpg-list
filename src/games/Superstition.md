<!-- Excerpt Start -->

You are an oracle, a greenseer, and a fraud. You do not believe in rituals, but you do believe in giving hope.
Does your community believe in you?

“Superstition” is a solo journaling rpg with light game elements where you create rituals for your community and answer questions about the rituals and the community’s reaction to them.
