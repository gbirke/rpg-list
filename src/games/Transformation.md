<!-- Excerpt Start -->

Transformation is a solo horror role-playing game in which
you chronicle the metamorphosis of an ordinary human
into something monstrous while their companion attempts
to cope.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

Transformation is a horror game. As such, it is designed
to elicit feelings of fear, discomfort, and well, horror. If you
are reading this, that is likely something you are actively
seeking. Experiencing horror in a controlled way should
be fun. Still, not all content is suitable for all audiences.
Transformation is intended for adult audiences; it isn’t
suitable for children.

You, the player, will create a fictional, point-of-view
character to center your experience of the story
around. As your character struggles through their
transformation, you will describe their thoughts,
feelings, and actions in your journal as if your character
were writing the experience themselves. The story is
yours to create. The rules presented here provide the
framework around which you will craft your story.
Each journey through Transformation will tell a different
story as a result of your choices and the random events
your character encounters. You’ll see the monster your
character becomes and how that horror affects those
around them.

Though the exact ending is unknown, one thing
is certain: the transformation is inevitable. Your
character might embrace it or struggle against it,
but as the player, you know that it will happen.
While Transformation is about an experience rather than
an objective, your character will have their own desires
and goals they are striving for. Play to see if your character
achieves them.

What You’ll Need to Play
To play Transformation, you will need the following supplies:

- This book
- A writing utensil
- A notebook, paper, or word processor program
- A standard deck of playing cards
