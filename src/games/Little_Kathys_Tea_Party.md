<!-- Excerpt Start -->
In Little Katy’s Tea Party, you will play as toys and imaginary friends
brought to life by the unlimited power of a little girl’s imagination: Katy.
You are now sitting at the tea party, but she is not here anymore. So,
you’ll recall the moments of her childhood where you stood with her - the difficult ones.

What happened to Katy? Were you able to guide her through her
childhood? What kind of price did you have to pay for protecting her?
Were your choices always the best for her? You will play to answer
these questions.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

After picking a Scenario, each player will create a Character while
filling some of the blanks in the setting.
You’ll then alternate between two phases of the game.

In the *Scenes*, you relive a childhood memory of a distressing
situation in the Game World. Each of the players takes on a different
Role, and you play to figure out whether a character was able to
protect Katy.

In the *Interlude*, player characters attend the Tea Party, and together
you reflect on the previous scene.

In the end, you play the Conclusion, finally figuring out Katy’s
destiny and how she remembers her childhood.
