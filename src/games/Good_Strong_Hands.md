Good Strong Hands is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) about fighting back against the darkness that threatens to destroy your world. Itâ€™s set in the fictional world of Reverie. A reverie is a daydream, a happy place to lose oneself. The world of Reverie has been just that for quite some time. But that could change.

You and your friends will tell stories of fantastic folk who strive to keep Reverie alive, to prevent the Void from consuming and destroying their beloved home. The stories you tell will be those of friendship, teamwork, self-empowerment, overcoming harmful forces, and dealing with a world in crisis.
