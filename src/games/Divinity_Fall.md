<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Divinity Fall is a solo journaling RPG with deck building
mechanics, about overthrowing oppressive Gods and
dismantling their structures of power. Players will use
prompts to worldbuild and generate scenarios; create pilots and their mechas; build decks that work narratively and
mechanically; manage resources; and roleplay as a beacon of
hope, on a journey to defeat terrible evils while trying their
best to survive.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

This game was made in June 2020 for the “Attack and
Dethrone God Jam” hosted by Blue Golem Games on itch.io.
It is inspired by - and stands in support of - all the protests
happening around the world for racial equality and human
rights. Narratively, it takes inspiration from Neon Genesis
Evangelion and Mobile Suit Gundam 00.
