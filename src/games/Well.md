The Well is a roleplaying engine made for larger- than-life stories and nearly free-form play, while still allowing a GM to prepare some authorial snippets ahead of time. Subplot skeletons and interesting details are created and connected to Story Tokens which activate during the session in a way that surprises the whole group – GM included!


Player choices affect the world & story right from the beginning of the session before the roleplaying even starts – tokens representing forces in the world are amplified every time they are returned to The Well. Players can jump between characters to follow different threads, creating them on-the-fly. This game is intended for ongoing play, with mechanics tuned for pacing and foreshadowing future events instead of resolving immediate successes & failures.
