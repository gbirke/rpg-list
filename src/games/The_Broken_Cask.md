<!-- Excerpt Start -->
This is a solitaire (that is, single-player or solo) roleplaying game about owning and operating
an inn in a medieval fantasy world. It’s your dining room table covered in papers and charts;
it’s slinging dice to find out what happens next; it’s hoping that slowcoach cook of yours can get
the next meal out in time for a hefty tip and wondering who will come through the door next.

You play it with paper and pencil and at least one six-sided die.

It may inspire you to imaginative feats and storytelling of your own, or it may just be a good
time when you feel like relaxing and playing alone.

You will create your inn and innkeeper persona, hire staff, earn gold, expand your inn, trade
at the market, send heroes off on adventures, and oh so much more. This is done by rolling
dice against random tables to generate events, then rolling again to see how you and your staff
handle those events. You keep track of things using a log and put yourself in the middle of the
action using your imagination.
