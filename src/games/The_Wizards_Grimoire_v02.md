<!-- Excerpt Start -->

In The Wizard’s Grimoire, you’re a conjurer, scholar, rogue, and minor wizard, and you’ve come into possession of an ancient and powerful grimoire, the Signature of Aibesta of the Two Courts. Will it see you to triumph and the achievement of your every ambition, or will you destroy yourself in the pursuit?

The Wizard’s Grimoire is a pen-and-paper rpg with a twist. Instead of a GM saying, “hey, I have this game I’d like to run, who’s in?” you say, “hey, I’m trying to get my wizard through this spellbook, do you have a minute?”

You need two friends who’ll volunteer to play with you. Each session that you play is an episode in your wizard’s study and adventures. They can be as short or as long as you like, you can play as often or rarely as you like, and you can have different volunteers, or the same ones, every time you play.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

The Wizard’s Grimoire uses a dice pool version of PbtA. You’ll need a handful of 6-sided dice.
