<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Anamnesis is a solo journaling game about
self-discovery, reflection, and identity.

You play as an individual who has woken up
with memory loss. You do not remember
who you are, where you are, or what you
care about.

As you draw tarot cards, you fill the blank
spaces of your past, and learn more about
your present.

To play, you need a deck of tarot cards and a
way to record your thoughts (pen & paper,
audio recording, etc.).
