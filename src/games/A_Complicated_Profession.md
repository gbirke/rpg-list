<!-- Excerpt Start -->

What do bounty hunters do when the galaxy no longer needs them?

In *A Complicated Profession*, they start new careers **hosting intergalactic cruises** for fickle passengers in lawless space.

Reunite your disbanded crew of bounty hunters, jaded sidekicks, shabby droids and shady accomplices. Then pick a hosting role and start a new life together.
