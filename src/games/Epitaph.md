<!-- Excerpt Start -->

A game of Epitaph is the story of someone’s life, starting with how
they died and jumping freely between their most important
moments. We learn about this person by looking back and seeing all
the threads that formed the fabric of their world and choices.
Together we have an opportunity to create something truly rare in
our own lives: a complete picture of how the events we experience
shape who we become.

Epitaph is a storytelling game. The goal of play is to tell a story
together, enjoying the twists and turns as we each contribute to the
narrative. The main character of our story is called the Departed,
and we’ll focus on this one person throughout our game.
