Fortunes: The Tarot Card storytelling game might be played after a rousing
seance or during the quietest hours of the night, ideally in a room with a
candle. It could be played by an eccentric family who lives in a
dilapidated mansion on a hill overlooking a small town in autumn, or it
could be played by a curious young couple sitting on a hay bale as a
harvest festival finally winds down on a Sunday evening. However it is
played, Fortunes is a game for storytellers.
