<!-- Excerpt Start -->
B roken Tales tells dark stories, reinterpreting
fairytales from an upside-down perspective. Players will
become part of the Order, a secret group operating on
behalf of the Papacy to investigate supernatural events
beyond human comprehension. Moving through an 18th
century Europe imbued with mysticism and horror, the
main characters of Broken Tales are nothing less than the
former antagonists of fairytales, thrown into a new world
resulting from the wish of the Child Savior.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

## The Game System
Broken Tales uses a role-playing rule system called Monad
Echo. The system aims to be fast, encourage storytelling,
and avoid pauses while playing. All this, while allowing
Players a great degree of freedom.
This rulebook is based on the Monad System, a universal
role-playing system created by The World Anvil collective.
Monad Echo is not a lite version of the Monad System, but
rather a totally new system that shares terminology and
action resolution mechanics with the original system while
focusing on a more narrative and cinematic style.
