Partners is a totally unique new storytelling game for exactly two
players. A love letter to the police procedural and mystery of the week
television genre, players take the roles of detectives hot on a murder
case each session of play. Not only are you playing the two irascible,
ill-matched detectives, you'll also play their boss, their subordinates
and other familiar roles of mystery television.
