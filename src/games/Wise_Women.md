<!-- Excerpt Start -->

WISE WOMEN is a tabletop roleplaying game about witches living in a
remote village, where life is difficult and threatened by the caprices of
nature, supernatural creatures and human pettiness. They know how to
use plant magic to protect their community, but have to navigate its
taboos and prejudices against their abilities. While they cannot survive
without their neighbours, when they are hurt, dismissed and pushed too
far, they might turn to dark magic to bend the village to their will and settle
their scores. But no matter how they choose to use their skills, they risk
banishment and uncertain fate if discovered.

The players take on the roles of the witches and describe their actions,
thoughts and feelings throughout the game, while the MC (Mistress of
Ceremonies) presents what happens in the village and portrays the nonplayer characters (NPCs).

Different groups like different levels of playersâ€™ involvement in
worldbuilding. Choose whatever suits you all best and feel free to have
the MC come up with the village and NPCs or to do it all together!
