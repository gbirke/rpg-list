The world is full of magic. Some we know about, most we donâ€™t. Sometimes, in exceptional circumstances, an ordinary object becomes imbued with magic, giving it strange powers and turning it into a Curio. You are a Collector of Curios. Why? Well, everyone has their reasons...

The Collector is a solo storytelling game and creative exercise inspired by Warehouse 13 and The Librarians.
