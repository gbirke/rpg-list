A 2 player TTRPG about a will oâ€™ the wisp leading a mortal through a bog.


Wisp is a 2 player game about stillness and movement, mystery and
conflict, small moments in the shifting relationship between two lost
beings as they wander through a damp, unpleasant, and strangely beautiful
place. It is a conversation between players as you build the story
together, learning more about your characters along the way. Draw cards
and follow story prompts to set and resolve scenes as the Mortal and the
Wisp observe each other, grow together and apart and together again, and
shift back and forth on a spectrum of moods. How far will they travel?
Will they get what they want, what they need? How will the journey change
them?
