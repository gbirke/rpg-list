Project
Project Cassandra is a game of the Cold War, of secret
government projects and the search for super-powered
individuals by those on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
It tells the tale of a classified research project into
precognition that not only succeeded but predicted a
cataclysmic event that could upset the delicate balance
of power between East and West. Hindered by government
bureaucracy and the machinations of a global conspiracy,
the subjects of Project Cassandra must take it upon
themselves to prevent the world from descending into
nuclear Armageddon.

A game of Project Cassandra is centred on a single
mission, spanning 1-4 sessions, as the players intervene
in a pivotal moment in the history of the Cold War. The
underlying Precognition Engine is designed to put the
psychic abilities of the characters front and centre by
providing players with narrative input that supplements
the threats, events and individuals introduced by the GM.
