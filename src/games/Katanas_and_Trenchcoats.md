<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Katanas & Trenchcoats is a work of bullshit. If we did our jobs right,
it’s fun bullshit. Still, total bullshit. The premise of this roleplaying
game is pandering, the setting ridiculous and meta, with vocabulary
and graphic design that borders on being just a little too much…
Those are selling points, friends. Those are why you’d play
this game.

The premise is about celebrating the moody vibe of supernatural
media—books, movies, television shows, RPGs—especially that of
the 1990s. If you loved shows like Highlander, Forever Knight, or Buffy
or Charmed or Angel or Supernatural, if you fondly remember playing
games like In Nomine or various World of Darkness settings, this
game seeks to play on your nostalgia.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

And because of an unreasonable obsession with movies like The
Fast and the Furious franchise, we’ve also worked some ridiculous
action hero inspiration into this hot dish of chaos. It’s like a little
garnish on top in homage to Blade.

The setting takes all that further. We’re not just saying, “You’re
protagonists in a story that’s like a ’90s TV show.” No. The Darkest
Cosmos—yeah, that’s the name of the setting—is an actual meta-entity that wants your characters to entertain it and treats their lives
like they’re in such a story. The world works with TV drama logic.
Because we’re not looking to model physics or semi-realistic consequences here.
