<!-- Excerpt Start -->
In Fedora Noir, you create the story of a flawed private investigator in the style of a film noir. Players take on the roles of the Detective, their Partner, their Flame – and their Hat, the Detective’s sharp mind and inner voice. Together, players explore the Detective’s messy life against the backdrop of a difficult case.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

In Fedora Noir, two players share control of the story’s main character: the Detective and the Hat.

The Detective role-plays a private eye on a case, narrating their actions and speech. But here’s the catch – the person role-playing the Detective doesn’t get to say what they think. That’s the Hat’s job.


Throughout the game, the Hat narrates the Detective’s thoughts, memories, and feelings, providing a voiceover for your story in classic film noir fashion.


The other two main characters – the Partner and the Flame – provide the Detective with personal relationships. People to care about… or disappoint.


The game emulates classic detective film noir – the corrupt authorities, twisted cases, friends you can’t quite trust – as players create their own unique stories.


The game has a short set-up and tight act structure, so you can tell a complete story in the time it would take you to watch a movie. You’ll create a different story each time you play – different cases, different settings, different character
